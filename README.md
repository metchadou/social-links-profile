## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS

### What I learned

This project made me learn about variable fonts. This was the first time I come accross this concept.

Here is how I loaded the variable font 'Inter':
```css
@font-face {
    font-family: 'Inter';
    src: url(assets/fonts/Inter-VariableFont_slnt\,wght.ttf) format('truetype');
    font-weight: 100 900;
    font-style: normal;
}
```

### Useful resources
